    <h2>The Story of Exclusive Books</h2>

    <p>Exclusive Books has a rich history -
         a colourful past of peaceful protest, 
         fascinating stories and a family of staff, 
         all boasting eclectic and wide-ranging knowledge. 
         We are more than a store: we are a shared cultural 
         touchpoint with personality and authority made 
         possible through passion and an undying love of literature.
         <br>

        We opened our first store on King George Street 
        in Johannesburg in 1951 and have since expanded 
        to over 40 stores with one in Botswana, one in Namibia, 
        and one that can only be found in the sky 
        - www.inclusivebooks.co.za. While we may be online, 
        at heart we remain as we started out: a quirky local bookstore 
        staffed by the keenest of readers and still crazy about 
        books after all these years.</p>
